# How to Play

- The game involves making decisions on behalf of a country.
- You are left in charge with a sum of Money, along with 5 types of resources:
    - Manufacturing
    - Energy
    - Services
    - Defence
    - Agriculture

- You play the game by making simple Yes/No decisions.
    - Every time you “Advance Time”, an event appears. These describe some world event in which you have to decide how to respond, in a way you believe would work out best for your country.
    - Some events may require certain resource levels or relationships with other regions in order to Accept.
    - The outcome of your decision has an impact on your:
        - resources
        - money
        - relationships with regions
        - GDP (which acts as a score metric).
- In-between events, you unlock the ability to trade.
    - Since events may cost money to Accept, your way of making that money is trading your resources with other regions.
    - Regions set their prices of a certain resource based on their supply, so aim to sell to regions with a shortage!
    - But be careful, if your relationship with a region becomes too low, they will refuse to trade.

- The aim of the game is simply to survive the duration of your playtime (don’t go bankrupt!), and aim for a highest score (GDP) as possible.
